Before I started the project, I was quite pessimistic. I thought that the project would not be finished and I saw the project as a very difficult target. 
When I started to do the project, I saw that it was actually not that difficult and could be done easily with teamwork. 
In particular, I learned new things such as using and connecting to the database. We worked as a team while learning new things. 
The most challenging thing for me in this regard was the use of github and the codes were constantly getting mixed up. 
If I started the project once again, I would like to get a faster interface by making database improvement. 
I spent almost 1 week on the project, including only the code and GUI design phase. 
In addition, we have thought about the project stages in before as many times. 
Taking part in such a project gave me experience. Now think that I can develope new Java Apps much better.

I learned new technologies such as APIs and databases. Also, this project was the biggest project 
I have ever done, so I learned a lot about operating in a team. Updating the project and debugging 
was sometimes hard with four different people working on the project, but it was not too bad. For me, 
the most challenging aspect of the project was trying to code similarly to other members when everyone 
is working at the same time. If I had to start over, I would be more focused on using GitHub effectively
with group members. I spent a week or two purely coding and a lot more time planning before that, similar 
to other group members. I am proud of what we achieved.
